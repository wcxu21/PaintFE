# Changelog

All notable changes to PaintFE are documented here. Dates are in YYYY-MM-DD format.

The format is loosely based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

---

## [1.0.12] - 2026-03-03

### Added
- Async resize: Resize Image and Resize Canvas now run in a background thread with a loading spinner, keeping the UI responsive during large canvas operations.
- Exit dialog Save As flow: clicking "Save" in the exit confirmation dialog now opens sequential Save As dialogs for each unsaved untitled project before exiting.
- Auto-focus: Resize Image and Resize Canvas dialogs now auto-focus the width field when opened via keyboard shortcut.
- Reusable `open_save_as_for_project(idx)` helper, eliminating duplicated Save As setup code across handle_save and close-tab flows.

### Changed
- Exit dialog redesigned with three centered, same-size buttons: Save, Exit Without (red), and Cancel.
- Close-tab unsaved changes dialog buttons now use uniform sizing.
- Layers panel context menu reorganized: added separator between layer management and property toggle groups.

## [1.0.11] - 2026-02-28

### Added
- Single-instance IPC via Windows named pipe: right-click "Open with PaintFE" sends the file to the running instance instead of launching a duplicate. New instances forward paths and focus the existing window.
- Positional file argument support: `paintfe.exe photo.png` opens the image directly (file association / drag-onto-exe).

### Fixed
- Selection overlay (rect, ellipse, crosshatch, border segments) now pixel-snaps when zoomed in, making pixel art selection precise.
- Selection tools (rect, ellipse, lasso) and gradient handles can now be dragged outside the canvas area. Dragging from outside to the other side selects the full canvas edge-to-edge.

### Changed
- Windows binaries statically link vcruntime via `.cargo/config.toml` (`crt-static`), eliminating the Visual C++ Redistributable dependency.

---

## [1.0.10] - 2026-02-25

### Fixed
- AppImage: window/taskbar icon now appears correctly on Wayland (GNOME, KDE). On first launch the icon is installed to `~/.local/share/icons/hicolor/256x256/apps/` so Wayland compositors can resolve it by app-id.

### Security
- Added Dependabot configuration for weekly Cargo and GitHub Actions dependency updates.
- Fixed `release.yml` workflow token permissions to default `read-all` (the `release` job already scoped `contents: write` to only the upload step).
- All 8 `cargo audit` unmaintained-crate warnings are now acknowledged in `audit.toml` with context; they are transitive dependencies locked by `eframe`/`wgpu`/`rfd` with no known exploits.

---

## [1.0.9] - 2026-02-25

### Added
- `SECURITY.md` with private vulnerability reporting process, coordinated disclosure timeline, and user-facing security guidance.
- Automated SHA-256 checksum file (`checksums-SHA256.txt`) published alongside binaries on every GitHub Release.
- OpenSSF Scorecard GitHub Action (`scorecard.yml`) for automated security posture scoring.

### Fixed
- Resolved all 556 Rust 1.93 Clippy lints (`needless_range_loop`, `manual_clamp`, `match_like_matches_macro`, `ptr_arg`, `field_reassign_with_default`, `wrong_self_convention`, `if_same_then_else`, `doc_lazy_continuation`, `needless_update`, `struct_update_has_no_effect`) to restore a clean CI gate.
- Corrected `dtolnay/rust-toolchain` action SHA in `ci.yml`.

---

## [1.0.8] - 2026-02-21

### Fixed
- MSIX manifest: corrected `DefaultTile` schema, removed invalid `LockScreen` element, fixed version regex for `MinVersion` to avoid corrupting the XML declaration during CI packaging.

---

## [1.0.7] - 2026-02-21

### Fixed
- MSIX manifest: replaced invalid `MaxVersion` attribute with `MaxVersionTested` to pass Store validation.

---

## [1.0.6] - 2026-02-20

### Fixed
- MSIX build CI step: switched manifest patching to use `-creplace` to prevent the BOM being reintroduced and corrupting the XML declaration.

---

## [1.0.5] - 2026-02-20

### Fixed
- MSIX manifest BOM: changed CI step to read raw bytes, strip the UTF-8 BOM explicitly, then write back to guarantee a clean manifest regardless of PowerShell pipeline encoding.

---

## [1.0.4] - 2026-02-19

### Fixed
- MSIX manifest BOM: switched from `Get-Content` pipeline to `ReadAllText` + `TrimStart` to reliably strip the BOM before packaging.

---

## [1.0.3] - 2026-02-19

### Fixed
- AppImage build: corrected icon path in the `.desktop` file so the launcher icon resolves correctly.
- MSIX build: resolved UTF-8 BOM issue in manifest and added publisher identity fields required for Store submission.

---

## [1.0.1] - 2026-02-18

### Added
- AppImage packaging (`packaging/appimage/`) with build script and desktop integration files.
- MSIX packaging (`packaging/msix/`) for Microsoft Store submission, including icon asset generation and CI workflow step.
- GitHub Actions release workflow building Windows binary, Linux binary, and AppImage on tag push.
- Flatpak manifest (`packaging/flatpak/`) for distribution via Flathub.

### Fixed
- AppImage `AppRun` and build script execute permissions set correctly in the repository.
